Note: substitute the placeholder text in <> with your personal details.

1. Create UGent github account: https://github.ugent.be/ (log in with UGent username (not email adress!) and UGent password)

Video for steps 2. and 3. : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGcpVQlhbuI
2. Generate SSH key: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=mac
(Follow these steps "Generating a new SSH key" and "Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent")

Note: the SSH config file should be different for UGent account than in the tutorials above. 
The config file is located in the .ssh folder, which has the path C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh, by default.

Replace the config file's content with this (with IdentityFileRelativePath by default: ~/.ssh/id_ed22519):

Host github.ugent.be
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile IdentityFileRelativePath

3. Add (copy paste) SSH key to github account: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=mac

4. Download and install Visual studio code (VSCODE)
5. Install github extensions for VScode: Remote repositories, Github Repositories, Github Pull request
- (optional) Install usefull VScode extensions: Python, Jupyter, SVG previewer, ...

6. Check if git is installed (should be fine for MAC)
- execute in terminal:

    git --version

- if no error (for example a good response is "git version 2.41.0") -> everything is fine.

7. Setup username and email in git config file:

- Execute in terminal:

git config --global user.name "<UGentUsername>"

- Execute in terminal:

git config --global user.email "<UGentEmail@UGent.be>"

These can be checked via:

git config --global user.name 

git config --global user.email

8. Check SSH connection: 

- execute in terminal:

ssh -T git@github.ugent.be

- If prompted:
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
    
  Execute in terminal: 
    yes

- Upon succes the response is:
Warning: Permanently added 'github.ugent.be' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Hi <UGentUsername>! You've sucessfully authenticated, but Github does not provide shell acess.

9. Clone a repository (ensure you have access to the repository you want to clone):
- Open search bar (at the top) of Vscode
- Click on "Show and Run Commands"
- Search: "git:clone"
- Provide repository URL (in “provide repository URL or pick a repository source.”)
- Choose repository location on computer

10. (optional) Follow setup instructions (setup.py or README) of the repository

11. Check pushing and pulling: 
- Alter a file
- Go to source control (left panel VScode)
- Give in a random message (there MUST be a message) and commit
- Sync (Push and pull)
- Check if your changes are adapted in the used ugent.github repository
