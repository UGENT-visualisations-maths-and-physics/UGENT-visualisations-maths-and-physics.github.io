The argument principle gives for a closed, smooth Jordan curve $\gamma$, entirely within the domain $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, and $f$ a meromorphic function in $\Omega$ whose poles all lie inside $\gamma$, and such that $f(z) \neq 0$ for $z \in \gamma$. $\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\gamma} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\,dz= N_{\gamma}(f) - P_{\gamma}(f)$,where $N_{\gamma}(f)$ and $P_{\gamma}(f)$ denote, respectively, the number of zeros and poles of $f$ inside $\gamma$, each counted with multiplicity.
