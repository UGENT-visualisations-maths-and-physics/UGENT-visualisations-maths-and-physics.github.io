Note: substitute the placeholder text in <> with your personal details.

1. Create UGent github account: https://github.ugent.be/ (log in with UGent username (not email adress!) and UGent password)

Video for steps 2. and 3. : ADD
2. Generate SSH key: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=windows
(Follow these steps "Generating a new SSH key" and "Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent")
3. Create SSH config file:

- Check the path to the .ssh folder (where it is located), by default this is C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh we will call this path "Path.ssh".
- Open powershell as administrator (https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/open-an-elevated-powershell-prompt/#:~:text=Right%2Dclick%20on%20%E2%80%9CWindows%20PowerShell,Administrator%E2%80%9D%20in%20the%20title%20bar.)
- Execute in powershell, (replace <Path.ssh>, with your path to the ssh folder):

New-Item -Path <Path.ssh>\config -ItemType File -Force

- Go to the config file (located in the path above), open it and replace its content with the following (with <RelativePathIdentityFile> per default: ~/.ssh/id_ed22519):

Host ugent.github.be
    HostName github.ugent.be
    User <UgentUsername>
    IdentityFile <RelativePathIdentityFile>

4. Add (copy paste) SSH key to github account: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=windows

5. Download and install Visual studio code (VSCODE)
6. Install github extensions for VScode: Remote repositories, Github Repositories, Github Pull request
- (optional) Install usefull VScode extensions: Python, Jupyter, SVG previewer, ...

7. Check if git is installed:
- execute in terminal:

    git --version

- git is not pre-installed for Windows, so we probably get an error:
'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

- If we get this error -> install git https://git-scm.com/download/win

- Check installation, by executing in terminal:

    git --version

An example of good response is "git version 2.46.0"

8. Setup username and email in git config file:

- Execute in terminal:

git config --global user.name "<UGentUsername>"

- Execute in terminal:

git config --global user.email "<UGentEmail@UGent.be>"

- These can be checked via:

git config --global user.name 

git config --global user.email

9. Check SSH connection: 

- execute in terminal:

ssh -T git@github.ugent.be

- If prompted:
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
    
  Execute in terminal: 
    yes

- Upon succes the response is:
Warning: Permanently added 'github.ugent.be' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Hi UGentUsername! You've sucessfully authenticated, but Github does not provide shell acess.

10. Clone a repository (ensure you have access to the repository you want to clone):
- Open search bar (at the top) of Vscode
- Click on "Show and Run Commands"
- Search: "git:clone"
- Provide repository URL (in “provide repository URL or pick a repository source.”)
- Choose repository location on computer

11. (optional) Follow setup instructions (setup.py or README) of the repository

12. Check pushing and pulling: 
- Alter a file
- Go to source control (left panel VScode)
- Give in a random message (there MUST be a message) and commit
- Sync (Push and pull)
- Check if your changes are adapted in the used ugent.github repository
