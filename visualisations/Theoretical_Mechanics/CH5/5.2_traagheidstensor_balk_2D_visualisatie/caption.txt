Graphical representation of the relationship between the angular velocity vector $\bm{\omega}$ (gray) and the angular momentum vector $\bm{L}$ (red) for a rectangular beam with inertia tensor $\mathbf{I}$. 
The directions of $\bm{L}$ and $\bm{\omega}$ do not coincide due to the anisotropy of the inertia tensor. 
The rectangular beam has dimensions 2, 1, and 0.2 along the x, y, and z axes respectively and is homogeneous in density.
