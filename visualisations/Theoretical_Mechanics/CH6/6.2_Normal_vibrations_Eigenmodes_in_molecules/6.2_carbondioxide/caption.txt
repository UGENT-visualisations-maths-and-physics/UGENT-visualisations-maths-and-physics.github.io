  Vibrational modes of CO$_2$: 3N=9 degrees of freedom total. 
  4 vibrational (shown: symmetric and asymmetric stretch, bending in/out-plane), 3 translational, 2 rotational. 
  Bending doubly degenerate (linear molecule). The springs between the C-O bonds and the corresponding generalized coordinate $\theta$ are omitted to avoid overloading the figure.
