The function \( g(z) = \cot(\pi z) \) has simple poles at \( z = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots \). If we consider the square \( V_N \) with center at the origin and side length \( 2N + 1 \), where \( N \in \mathbb{N} \), then we can compute the contour integral over \( \partial V_N^+ \) using the residue theorem.
