# Using Github on VS Code

This guide is for setting up github with VS Code. Using github with another IDE is possible, but most of the time involves using terminal a lot.

## 1: Download and install Visual studio code (VS Code)
https://code.visualstudio.com/
## 2: (optional) Install extensions for VS Code
- Github extensions: Remote repositories, Github Repositories, Github Pull request
- Some usefull extensions: Python, Jupyter, SVG previewer, ...

## 3: Clone a repository:
- Ensure you have access to a repository on github you want to clone, for example by making one.
- Open search bar (at the top) of VS Code
- Click on "Show and Run Commands"
- Search: "git:clone"
- Choose "Clone from GitHub" and pick a repository (if you have access to one, it should be visible)
- Choose location for clone of the repository on computer

## 4: (optional) Follow setup instructions (setup.py or README) of the repository

## 5: Check pushing and pulling: 
- Alter any file in the repository and save
- Go to source control (left panel VS Code)
- Give in a random message (there MUST be a message!) and commit
- Sync (Push and pull)
- Go to the github page on the web and check if your changes are adapted in visible under "commits"
