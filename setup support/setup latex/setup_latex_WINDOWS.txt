1. Download LaTeX contribution:
MiKTeX (https://miktex.org/)

2. Install "LaTeX workshop" extension in VSCODE.

3. Check latexmk installation:
- Execute in terminal:
latexmk --version

- If error: 'latexmk', is not recognized as command
-> install latexmk via MiKTeX:
- Open Miktex Console
- Type 'latexmk' in search bar and click install

- Verify installation via:
latexmk --version

4. Check if perl is installed:
perl -v

- If error: 'perl' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
-> install perl:
-Download the MSI file from strawberry perl (most popular perl version) (https://strawberryperl.com/)
-Run the installation

- Verify installation via:
perl -v

- If there's still an error (after restarting terminal), check if perl is added to SYSTEM's PATH, otherwise add it (https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)

5. Compile a latex file: if everything is properly installed a green run button "Build LaTeX project" should be visible, run it.


Note: 
The only relevant latex files, are files present befor compilation, such as .tex files. 
Files generated after compilation, such as .aux, .log, etc., are specific to your computer and should not be tracked and added to GitHub.
To avoid this, it is good practice to add them to a .gitignore file.
