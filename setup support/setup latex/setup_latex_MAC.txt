1. Download LaTeX contribution:
MacTex (https://www.tug.org/mactex/mainpage2024.html)

2. Install "LaTeX workshop" extension in VSCODE.

3. Compile a latex file: if everything is properly installed a green run button "Build LaTeX project" should be visible, run it.

Note: 
The only relevant latex files, are files present befor compilation, such as .tex files. 
Files generated after compilation, such as .aux, .log, etc., are specific to your computer and should not be tracked and added to GitHub.
To avoid this, it is good practice to add them to a .gitignore file.
